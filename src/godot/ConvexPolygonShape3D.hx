/**
	A 3D convex polyhedron shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a [CollisionShape3D].
	[ConvexPolygonShape3D] is [i]solid[/i], which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike [ConcavePolygonShape3D] which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.
	[b]Convex decomposition:[/b] A concave polyhedron can be split up into several convex polyhedra. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several [ConvexPolygonShape3D] nodes. To generate a convex decomposition from a mesh, select the [MeshInstance3D] node, go to the [b]Mesh[/b] menu that appears above the viewport, and choose [b]Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings[/b]. Alternatively, [method MeshInstance3D.create_multiple_convex_collisions] can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.
	[b]Performance:[/b] [ConvexPolygonShape3D] is faster to check collisions against compared to [ConcavePolygonShape3D], but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as [SphereShape3D] and [BoxShape3D]. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
